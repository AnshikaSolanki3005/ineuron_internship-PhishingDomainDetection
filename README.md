# ineuron_internship-PhishingDomainDetection

**Overview**
This project aims to detect phishing domains using machine learning techniques. It utilizes various data science methodologies to classify URLs as legitimate or phishing based on their features.

**Repository Structure**

* Architecture diagram.docx: Contains the overall architecture of the project.

* low level design.docx: Detailed design specifications and components.

* high level design.docx: Higher-level system design and flow.

* wireframe design.docx: User interface wireframes and design mockups.

* phish_data.csv: Dataset containing features and labels for phishing domains.

* PhishingDomainDetection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.

* readme.md: This file, providing an overview and guide to the project.

**Key Components**

1. Dataset
   
The phish_data.csv file contains features extracted from URLs and their corresponding labels (legitimate or phishing).

3. Code Implementation

The PhishingDomainDetection.ipynb notebook contains Python code for:

* Data preprocessing

* Feature engineering

* Model training and evaluation

* Predictions and results analysis

3. Design Documents
   
* Architecture Diagram: Visual representation of the project's architecture.

* Low Level Design: Detailed technical specifications and component interactions.

* High Level Design: Overview of the system's modules and their interactions.

* Wireframe Design: User interface mockups for potential deployment.

**Usage**

1. Environment Setup: Ensure Python environment with necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn) is set up.

2. Dataset Preparation: Load phish_data.csv into your environment.

3. Notebook Execution: Execute PhishingDomainDetection.ipynb step-by-step to:

  * Explore data

  * Train machine learning models

  * Evaluate model performance

4. Review Design Documents: Refer to architecture, low level, high level, and wireframe designs for detailed understanding.

5. Interpret Results: Analyze notebook outputs and model predictions to understand phishing domain detection effectiveness.

   
**Future Enhancements**

* Implement real-time domain monitoring.

* Integrate with web browsers for live URL checking.

* Enhance model accuracy with additional features and algorithms.
